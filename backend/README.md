# manage.py: a bridge to the database

The `manage.py` script bundles a set of utilities that facilitate interacting
with the database. To setup the connection to the detabase, the following
environment variables need to be set: `HOST`, `POSTGRES_DB`,
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_USER`. If not set, these will fallback to the
default values defined in the `.env` file at the root of the project.

## Requirements

The requirements for the script are in the `requirements.txt` file. To install
the requirements, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Getting started

After launching the database, it needs to be initialized with the schema and
loaded with the initial data. This can be done by running:

```sh
python manage.py setup
```

The command will execute the schema migrations (located in `migrations/`), seed
the election data, calculate the election results and refresh the `postgREST`
server.

### Preparing the demo

The database setup script **does not** populate the tables related to
vote-casting (`erststimmen`, `zweitstimmen` and `waehler`). This is because it
is expensive to do so (~ 30 minutes), especially for the `waehler` table: around
60 Million UUID strings need to be generated _and_ loaded into the database.
Thus, to allow for casting votes and see the live refresh, these tables are
populated for a given region. In order to do so, the following command can be
used:

```sh
python manage.py demo -w 220
```

The `-w` specifies the number corresponding to the given region (in this case,
`MÃ¼nch en-West/Mitte`). These can be found online, for example on
[bundeswahlleiter][wahlkreise]. The command will populate the aforementioned
tables, generate a "Helper Key", ten activation keys, and ten voter keys. Refer
to [the voting documentation](../docs/Voting.org) for more details on the role
of each key.

#### Refreshing the results

After casting votes, the results can be refreshed in two steps:

1. Updating the cached tally for the region
2. Re-distributing the seats

The following two commands achieve the desired outcome:

```sh
python manage.py aggregate -w 220
python manage.py calculate-results
```
